            <p><strong>You are clear and honest about what you want, and you don't like it when your needs are ignored. If something upsets you, you expect the other person to address it rather than leaving it unresolved, because you value resolution before moving on. You're not fond of overthinking and prefer to act based on your instincts rather than spending too much time analyzing. You value your freedom and dislike being controlled, wanting the ability to interact with others as you choose. You're self-aware, accepting your flaws, and expect others to do the same without judgment or trying to change you. While you act on feelings, you also think carefully before making decisions or asking for something.

                As a girl, you bring a unique strength and warmth to your relationships. You're nurturing yet independent, and you know how to balance caring for others with taking care of yourself. Your intuition often guides you, helping you read situations and people with a deeper understanding. You enjoy expressing yourself, whether it's through your creativity, your thoughts, or your actions, and you believe in staying true to who you are. You're also resilient, able to navigate challenges while remaining true to your values. Your sense of humor and light-heartedness often bring joy to those around you.</strong></p>
